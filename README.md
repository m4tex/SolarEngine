# SolarEngine
 Take two on a 3D-engine. The goal is to make a functional rasterizer with texture mapping. Optionally add global illumination and lightmap baking. Decided to go for OpenGL in the end, which kind of annoys me since I wanted to design my own little crappy system that I could later use as an explanation and a simplification for others. Not only that, it will now be GPU accelerated :(
 Well, since I am using both windows and linux on different working machines I had to go with something cross-platform. But someday... just you wait.
